In the university system so many girls are being harassed and get their sexual rights violated by wicked lecturers
They are threatened that if they speak about the request for sex in exchange for grades they may be killed, embarrassed or rusticated from the university
Unfortunately, with the corrupt system of government some of this lecturers get away with what they do and the girls don't get justice. They may speak but no one may believe them
So I want to device an online voting system and also a platform where anyone can anonymously air their views
They can come up with the name of the lecturers harassing them, if possible a tangible proof or evidence and be the first to vote for such lecturer to be probed or stripped off his job
Other girls who he has abused or approached in the past can also speak out about their experiences and vote for his punishment. Parents, lecturers and civil society can also lend their voices in order to get justice too for them that would further lead to his immediate sack or if possible imprisonment
This app or website would be presented to the school senate in order to be approved by the school for use
Which ever lecturer punished will serve as an example to others who are both dreaming to or already harassing the female students then the students can study in a conducive environment without fear of being sexually harassed and can work towards achieving their dreams in life
